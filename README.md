# MusicScaleImpromptu
A program to identify musical scales to entertain improvisation sessions. 



# Something I've done solely for my purposes. 

One of my biggest joy is listening through my playlists and harmonize together with random songs. 

This program helps you to identify the key when you are playing with a random song.


# Sails of Charon by Scorpions 
is playing from my playlist at this moment.

It starts with: 
# B3-B4-B4-A3-G3-F#3

I only know 4 notes.
It has F# but not G#, so there are 2 options left:

(1) C  D E F# G A B C
(2) C# D E F# G A B C#

Continued with C. (1)
#  It is on B Phyrigian 

Now, you can play it really fast without trying to guess the notes and the scale within listening. Moreover, you know all the triad chords. If you do not, you can build up any chords you want to.
